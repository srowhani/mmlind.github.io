Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between different variables. 
It's often used for analyzing dependencies and predicting values based on a given data set.

Regression represents one of the cornerstones of machine learning. 
Hence, understanding its underlying logic and math provides a solid foundation and a good preparation for exploring more advanced techniques such as neural networks.

The underlying idea of linear regression is simple: Given a data set, we want to find the dependency of one of the variables in the data set on one or number of other variables.
