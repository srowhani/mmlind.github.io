Finally! I launched my new hacking site. Following a recommendation on [Andrej Karpathy's blog](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/) I decided to use Jekyll and host it on Github.
Thanks to [Barry Clark's post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) it took only a few minutes to setup. And here we go.
