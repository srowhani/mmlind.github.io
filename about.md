I'm Matt[hias Michael] Lind, short Matt, a hobby hacker and artificial intelligence (more accurately machine intelligence) enthusiast based in Shanghai.

### Machine Intelligence

I'm working on using artificial neural networks (ANN) -- different flavors, mostly HTM and RNN+LSTM -- and machine learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
I'm especially interested in Jeff Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and the CLA (Cortical Learning Algorithm) that his company Numenta is working on.
If you haven't done so, I highly recommend reading his book "On Intelligence".
