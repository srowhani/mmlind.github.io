I'm Matthias Michael Lind, short Matt, a hobby hacker and machine intelligence (artificial intelligence) enthusiast based in Shanghai.

### Machine Intelligence

I'm working on using artificial neural networks (different flavors, mostly RNN/LSTM) and machine learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Recently I'm especially interested in Jeff Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and the CLA (Cortical Learning Algorithm) that his company Numenta is working on.
If you haven't done so, I recommend reading his book "On Intelligence".
