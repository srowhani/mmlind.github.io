I'm Matt Lind, a passionate hacker and machine learning enthusiast based in Shanghai.

### Machine Learning

I'm working on using artificial neural networks (ANN) -- different flavors (from normal fully connected to convolutional, sequentiell and reinforcement -- and machine learning for image recognition and NLP.

### in C

I'm mostly using C because I appreciate its simplicity, precision and speed. While some things may take a little longer to code in C, in the end they'll run amazingly fast and run (almost) anywhere.

### Artificial/Machine Intelligence

I'm especially interested in Jeff Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and the CLA (Cortical Learning Algorithm) that his company Numenta is working on.
If you haven't done so, I highly recommend reading his book "On Intelligence".
