I'm Matt Lind, a passionate hacker and machine learning enthusiast.

### Machine Learning

I like to explore the world of artificial neural networks (ANN) -- different flavors, from normal fully connected to convolutional, sequentiell and reinforcement -- for image recognition and NLP.

### in C

I'm coding in plain old C because I appreciate its simplicity, precision and speed. While some things may take a little longer to code in C, in the end they'll run amazingly fast and (almost) anywhere.

### Artificial/Machine Intelligence

I'm especially interested in Jeff Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and the CLA (Cortical Learning Algorithm) that his company Numenta is working on.
If you haven't done so, I highly recommend reading his book "On Intelligence".
